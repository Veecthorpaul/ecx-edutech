# Laravel-Multi-User-Authentication

This is a blank Laravel app with multi-user authentication.
It features:
- A default landing page
- A products page
- User and Admin Dashboard Pages
- Login, Register, Forget Password, Logout functionality for the User
- Login, Forget Password, Logout functionality for the Admin **(For now the Admin has to be added manually in the database as the register functionality is intended to be done only by the "Super Admin", which isn't present in the current version)**

These pages don't have any actual content, they are only there to serve as a template.

Place this app in the "**htdocs**" folder of your Xampp or Wampp and run it directly from your localhost. Use the SQL file "**blank.sql**" to import the tables into your database. Two default accounts have already been set up. Use the following account details to login as the default user/admin.

### User Account

**Email**: user@user.com

**Password**: useruser

### Admin Account

**Email**: admin@admin.com

**Password**: adminadmin
